# PYBER ANALYSIS & RESULTS

## PyBer Analysis Overview

PyBer is a python based ridesharing app company. The initial project was to perform exploratory analysis on data to showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This was to help PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
